    "## What is OOP\n",
    "The basis of OOP is creating *objects* which are collections of __attributes__ and __operations__. *Attributes* usually contain a value representing the state of the attribute. *Operations* are actions carried out by the object and often make use of an attribute. For example, lets say we want to create a `clock` object. To do this we should consider the attributes and operations that make up a clock.\n",

The *scope* of the problem you want to address is called the __problem domain__. Most projects start by defining a *problem domain*. This involves gather requirements and writing a *statement of scope* which briefly outlines what you, the developer, want to achieve.\n",
