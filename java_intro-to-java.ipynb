    "### 1. OOP: Object Orentated Programming\n",
    "The main characteristics of OOP are:\n",
    "- modularity: the code for an object can be written/maintained independently of the code for other objects. After it's created an object can easily be passed around inside the system.\n",
    "- information-hiding: interacting with an objects methods only, the details of it's internals are hidden.\n",
    "- code re-use: if an object already exists it can be used in your program\n",
    "- pluggability and debugging ease: if a particular object has problems you can remove it and replace with a different object"

    "### 2. Distributed\n",
    "Java is considered to be a *distributed* language because it provides support for distributed network technologies (__R__emote __M__ethod __I__nvocation, __U__niversal __R__esource __L__ocator). Additionally the dynamic class loading of Java allows code to be downloaded via the internet and executed."

    "- it's booleans can only have a `true` or `false` value as opposed to other languages where the booleans are represented by one and zero.\n",
    "- complex/obscure constructs such as pointers to memory locations (a feature of C and C++) have been removed. Instead Java only allows the manipulation of objects using object references."

    "Java supports *multi-threading* which allows several tasks to run concurrently, such as querying a database, performing long-running and complex calculations, and displaying a user interface. This allows Java to be resource efficient."

    "- prohibiting distributed programs from reading/writing to hard disk\n",
    "- verifying that all Java technology programs contain valid code\n",

    "### 6. Platform independent\n",
    "Some languages such as C++ require different platform-specific compilers meaning that a Linux implementation is different from a Windows implementation which is different from a a Mac implementation. Java on the other hand compiles to platform-independent Java bytecode. After the bytecode is created it's interpreted by a bytecode interpreter (the __J__ava __V__irtual __M__achine). In addition to the JVM, Java also needs a collection of standard Java class libraries. The JVM and class libraries are bundled together in the __J__ava __R__untime __E__nvironment."
